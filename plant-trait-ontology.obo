comment: The worms appear suddenly in masses and move like an army from field to field so that seedbeds or the direct seeded fields look as if grazed by cattles. Generally\, a transplanted crop is not severely affected. Damage by armyworms is most serious during periods of stem elongation and grain formation. Larvae defoliate plants\, typically by chewing angular pieces off leaves. They may also feed on the panicle near the developing kernels causing these kernels to dry before filling. This feeding causes all or parts of the panicle to  turn white. If the entire panicle is white\, the damage may also be due to stem rot or feeding by rats. The  seriousness of armyworm injury depends on the maturity of the plant and the amount of tissue consumed. Significant yield reduction can occur if defoliation is greater than 25% at 2 to 3 weeks before heading. They migrate from field to field and extensive losses are often caused within a week. Their migration is facilitated by the absence of standing water in the field.

Chlorophyll is a cyclic tetrapyrolle\, similar in structure to the heme group of globins (hemoglobin\, myoglobin) and cytochromes. Chlorophyll differs from heme in a few major respects\, most notably that the central metal ion in chlorophyll is magnesium while that in heme is iron.

[GR:pj, GrainGenes_trait:Acid detergent fiber, web:http\://www.foragetesting.org/lab_procedure/sectionB/4/part4.1.htm]
comment: The method typically uses acidified quaternary detergent solution to dissolve cell solubles\, hemicellulose and soluble minerals leaving a residue of cellulose\, lignin\, and heat damaged protein and a portion of cell wall protein and minerals (ash). Acid detergent fiber is determined gravimetrically as the residue remaining after extraction. The lower the acid detergent fiber\, the more digestible the feed is and the higher the energy value of the feed.
