This is the repository for the plant trait ontology.

Note that you are not a Planteome ontology developer then you are
probably in the wrong place. The TO can be accessed via its official
PURLs:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/to.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/to.obo
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/to/subsets/to-basic.obo

# Ontology Editors Guide

Ontology editors should edit plant-trait-ontology.obo using Protege5
beta18 or higher. DO NOT USE AN EARLIER PROTEGE. DO NOT EDIT A
DIFFERENT FILE!

Until beta18 is released you have to use this:

https://github.com/protegeproject/protege/issues/151#issuecomment-141599034

The release files are:

 * [to.obo](to.obo)
 * [to.owl](to.owl)

These are made using the Makefile.
